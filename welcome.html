    <p>
        I have been heavily involved with the creation, delivery, coordination, evaluation, and revision of learning initiatives across various eLearning modules, face-to-face events, and online training webinars. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My projects ran across a variety of digital media platforms where I used an assortment of video, audio, H5P, animations, GIFs, and other tools and techniques to adapt the training style to the online learning environment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am highly proficient in the Adobe Creative Cloud suite, Articulate 360 suite, and Microsoft Office suite, as well as operating and managing LMS systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The later is something which I have recently found I am enjoying immensely – in particular, problem solving and navigating any issues in the backend of our Moodle-based LMS system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have found when working in here though, that my limited knowledge with HTML, JavaScript and other coding languages has started to hinder my ability to resolve issues. I was finding this time consuming and frustrating, so earlier this year I applied and was very excitedly accepted into the She Codes Plus program for Brisbane 2023. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am loving the journey so far of learning all things code! I pride myself on being a lifelong learner who is agile enough to acquire new skills and knowledge within my life, and consequently apply them to any areas where I need self-improvement. I can’t wait to see where these new coding skills take me, as I know my adventure is just beginning!
